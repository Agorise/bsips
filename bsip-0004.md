# Abstract

Currently the BitShares network does not charge a percentage based market fee on
trades of the core asset (BTS) or assets created by the committee account
(BitAssets like USD, CNY, etc). Instead BitShares has a fixed price for filled
orders defined by the order creation fee. See [BSIP-0002](bsip-0002.md) for more
information.

This proposal is to implement a hard-fork that would grant committee members the
option to charge market fees for their assets. Any market fees earned would be
converted to BTS via the fee pool and then distributed to the referral program
like any other fees.

# Motivation

Market pegged assets trade at 0% market fees by default. The commitee members
could decide to set a percentage as fee already, but the fees would end up in
the committee's account.

By implementing this proposals, we let shareholders decide whether or not to
redirect these profits to the referral program.

# Discussion

When enabling market fees for an asset, trading becomes slightly more expensive
for traders and would discourage trades.
On the other hand, having more funds to distribute for marketing in the form of
referral rewards could improve exposure and incentivise to bring in new
customers for our products and the trading platform which may result in
increased profits from fees in general.
