# Abstract

Votes for witnesses are a measure of reputation in that they cast a persistent
opinion - so not like votes in the traditional sense of the word. The
witness voting system is currently designed to ensure stability by directing
the apathetic to vote for incumbents. Whilst this may have advantages, it
seems to present the danger that incumbents are likely to attain a
near-unassailable position (excepting of course those who exhibit negligent/bad
behaviour).

# Motivation

If the aim is the create an autocracy - albeit seeded by the active witnesses
or so original gainers of significant 'reputation' - then this is fine. However,
it would seem to discourage serious efforts to try and break into the active
circle by newcomers with much to contribute. At the end of the BitShares 1
network, circa. 220M votes were required and a quick browse of the delegates
showed that with a few notable exceptions, the majority have been in place since
a 4 or 5 digit block number - have all been of these current, active contributors?

# Specifications

A blockchain parameter can be added that enforces a minimal freshness to votes
that are counted and handle cases of lost keys or apathetic votes hanging
around.
