# Abstract

Asset issuers need a way to get out some CORE assets (BTS) from their assets' fee pool, for example when accidentally filled too much BTS into the pool. As of writing, this can be done by crafting a special limit order then cancel it, the process is a bit complicated. In addition, this approach will no longer work if [BSIP #26 (Refund Order Creation Fee in Originally Paid Asset on Cancel)](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0026.md) is implemented. This BSIP proposes a protocol change to meet the demand.

# Motivation

Make the asset system easier to use.

# Rational

Asset issuer should have full and easy control over the funds in the fee pool.

# Specifications

## Current Design and Implementation

Asset issuers can fill the fee pool with the `asset_fund_fee_pool_operation` operation, which has a structure as follows:
```
   struct asset_fund_fee_pool_operation : public base_operation
   {
      asset           fee; ///< core asset
      account_id_type from_account;
      asset_id_type   asset_id;
      share_type      amount; ///< core asset
      extensions_type extensions;
   };
```

The `amount` in the structure can only be positive, which means the `from_account` can only add some CORE asset (BTS) into an asset's fee pool.

## Proposed Changes

* Allow `amount` to be negative;
* When `amount` is negative, `from_account` can only be the issuer;
* When `amount` is negative, deduct the absolute amount from the asset's fee pool and add it to the issuer's balance.

# Discussion

The operation fee for `asset_fund_fee_pool_operation ` should be no less than `transfer_operation`.
