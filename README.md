# BitShares Improvement Protocol

BSIP stands for BitShares Improvement Proposal. A BSIP is a design document
providing information to the BitShares community, or describing a new feature for
BitShares or its processes or environment. BSIPs provide a concise
technical specification of features and a rationale for them.

The distinct document [BSIP Purpose and Guidelines](bsip-0001.md) gives a more
detailed explanation.
